### What interviewers want to know:

- How you think and tackle hard problems
- How you consider engineering tradeoffs (space vs time)
- How you communicate in English about technical problems
- Limits of what you know
  - Don’t feel bad if you don’t get all the answers right.
  
### Data Structures and Algorithms
- Implement, not memorize
- Discuss complexity (space and time trade-offs)
- Common library functions are fair game

### Specific questions about concepts are rare
- Unless you claim to be an expert or need to concept

### Format of a coding interview
Intro: Learn about your interviewer and share your past experiences
Coding:
- Majority of the time spent completing coding questions
- Don't worry if the interviewer stops you in the middle of a question to move on.
- Questions might have follow up components based on your implementation
- Be prepared to test your code, discuss how it works, and analyze its performance
- Phone screens use an online collaborative editor
  
### Steps to a successful interview
1. Repeat the question back to your interviewer to ensure your fully understand what's being asking
2. Ask questions about edge cases
3. Take your time to think about a solution before coding
4. Start coding while explaining your entire thought process. It's encouraged to talk out loud. Don't worry if you run into trouble. Feel free to ask your interviewer for a hint. 
5. Run through your solution with test cases. Continue talking out loud.
6. Iterate how can you do better with runtime/memory?
7. 注意接收面试官的反馈信息，hint意味着面试官可能发现了bug，希望你改正，要收到并理解这个信息

### Example: 
#### determine a tree is a BST:
- What's a binary search tree? make sure to clarify!
- How is the tree structure represented? (class)
- Advantages of using an iterative vs. a recursive approach.
- What is the runtime space or time complexity of it.
#### About BQ
- Be prepared to talk about common questions:
- Most recent, most challenging favorite project context, action, result
- if a tech is on your resume, KNOW IT
- Be reflective when preparing
- For group projects, be prepared to talk about the collaboration as well as individual contribution

#### Post interview
- Have 1 or 2 questions prepared for the interviewer
    - you are interviewing the company as well
    - Focus on what matters to you the most
    - Contact the recruiter with any questions or follow ups
### Final tips
1. Think out loud
2. Ask lots of questions
3. Write good code
4. Test your code
5. Iterate on your solution
6. Be yourself
   
- Practice on a whiteboard
  - leave whitespace between questions
  - Time yourself
- For phone screens, go somewhere quiet with a good internet connection
    - Use headphones to free your hands for coding
- Mock!
